## What really is the ANOVA?

Actually ANOVA came from **AN**alysis **O**f **VA**rience which is statistical technique to inference about the sample data by analysis focus on the varience;to be exact it is focus on minimizing the **Sum Square analysis.** \\(SS\\)

The methode of analysis could summarize in 3 steps
1. Identify original state; null hypothsis (\\(H\_{0}\\)) : if we do ANOVA to test if where is different mean within groups of data , orginal state is all group \\(SS\\) are _minimized_ at central _moment_, or **grand mean** \\(\bar{Y}\bullet\bullet\\). Whereas, if we test linear regression \\(y ~ x\\) original state is there is no effect of \\(x\\) on \\(SS\\) of \\(y\\), or the \\(SS\\) of \\(y\\) are the \\(y\\) it self already _minimized_ with not effect from other factors.

2. Calculate the effect of **Treatment** on \\(SS\\): If we test a different mean in groups of data, then we are _insert_ new   
_moment_ and observed if yield _more minimized_ \\(SS\\) when data hang with each group mean \\(\bar{Y}\bullet\\)
